    <br>In the lowlands the climate is typically tropical with an average temperature of 27°C in Colombo. In the higher elevations it can be quite cool with temperatures going down to 16°C at an altitude of over 2,000 meters.

    Bright, sunny warm days are in abundance and are common even during the height of the monsoon. Climatically Sri Lanka has no off season. The south – west monsoon brings rain mainly from May to July to the western, southern and central regions of the island, while the north-east monsoon rains occur in the northern and eastern regions from December to January.</section>
<section class="paragraph"><b>Seasonal Events</b>
    <br>
    <br>Sri Lanka is a multi ethnic country and celebrates a wide range of Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim festivals. The Kandy Esala Perahera (July, August) is one of the country’s most important and spectacular pageants. 10 days of vibrant processions bring together torch-bearers, whip-crackers, Kandyan dancers, drummers, colorfully dressed Elephants, throngs of devotees from all over the country and spectators from around the world.

    The Sacred Tooth Relic is honoured with great respect by the end of the festivities.

        <br><mark>Leopard watching in Sri Lanka is a favourite activity that many tourists love to enjoy while visiting the island on a holiday. This subspecies of leopard that are considered as endangered are observed well in Sri Lanka while they share their habitat with carnivores animals such as hyenas.<br>
    <br>The river is a picturesque place and perfect for taking pictures. But I know quite a few people who enjoyed feeding baby elephants. If you take a look at the time table you can see that it is possible to enjoy both these activities in around 2 hours. So I’d say 9.00AM to 11.00AM and 4.00PM to 6.00PM as the best times to visit the orphanage.</mark></article></td>

        <br><mark>The eastern and northern coastal beaches stretches north in a gentle arc from Arugam Bay up to Kuchchaveli approximately 275 km along the east coast. Pristine beaches, wide stretches of sand and what seems like miles of clear and shallow water, pretty bays and coves, deep natural harbours, still lagoons and underwater coral gardens will always take your breath away.<br>
        <br>The best beaches along the east coast include Nilaveli, Kuchchaveli, Marble Bay, Sweat Bay and the Dead Man’s Cove with its magnificent harbour, towards the north of Trincomalee. The southern section of the east coast includes the peaceful and beautiful beaches of Passikudah, Kalkudah and Arugam Bay.</mark></article></td>

        <br><mark>Sri Lanka is one of Asia’s richest treasure troves of both natural and man-made wonders. Royal and sacred cities, colonial strongholds, temple caves and virgin forests with no fewer than Eight World Heritage Sites in Sri Lanka declared and listed by UNESCO.<br>
    <br>According to inscriptions found in the caves which honeycomb the base of the rock fortress, Sigiriya served as a place of religious retreat as far back as the third century BC, when Buddhist monks established refuge in the locale. It wasn’t until the fifth century AD, however, that Sigiriya rose briefly to supremacy in Sri Lanka, following the power struggle which succeeded the reign of Dhatusena (455-473) of Anuradhapura.</mark></article></td>
